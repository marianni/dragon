# Creating of scenes

## Dragon egg view

We used the model of the castle from internet. Link available here <a href="https://free3d.com/3d-model/fantasy-castle-40715.html">Castle model</a>.
<br>
We created simple model of dragon egg. We tried to use the cell fraction to break the egg. Cell fraction is special add on using to break the object's surface. This add on use the Woronoi algorithm for breaking surface as well. Unfortunately this add on is using Blender game engine and this kind of add on is incompatible with Particle system. Engine is used for rendering. We decided to not include cracking surface of dragon's egg in final animation. 
<br>
Next we created green grass using Particle system. First we added new mesh - plane. To this plane we add modifier particle system. We set up some properties like type of material - dirt and grass, type of particle system - hair, hair-length etc.
On the grass we can see the wind is blowing.

## Dragon egg view and egg's cracks

On this scene we were using camera motion after the spline. Scene where are showing egg's cracks we were using key frames to create camera motion.

## Newborn dragon

On the third scene we can see newborn dragon. Motion of dragon is created by key frames.

## Dragon flight

Dragon flight scene is composed by dragon's walk, raining and dragon flight. Motions of dragon are created by key frames. Rain is created by particle system. First we create mesh-plane and then we added modifier particle system. On this scene we used own model of rain drop. In particle system properties we assind this object(rain drop) to particle system modifier.

## Dragon spitting the fire

On this scene dragon stands on his lower legs and spitting the fire. First we create object-fire and smoke domain. To object fire we added modifier Smoke. We set to this modifier Flow type - fire. To smoke domain we add modifier Smoke as well. We set Smoke type to "Domain". In the property "Smoke cache" we used "Bake", to make fire effect visible. Render baking is pre-computing something in order to speed up some other process later down the line.

## Final scene 

On final scene we created dragon's flight using key frames. Motion of object-sun is after spline. Motion of camera is created by key frames.
